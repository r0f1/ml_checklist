#### Explorative Data Analysis 

Find out if the following predictive modelling will be successful?

+ Getting everything into one big table (DataFrame)
+ Combine files
+ Fix encoding issues
+ Cleaning column names
+ Investigation
  + Non-sensical observations/artifacts?
  + Coding of categorical features?
  + Missing values?
  + Constant values (=Zero Importance)?
  + Low importance features?
  + Collinear/correlated/dependent features?
  + Highly skewed features?
  + Outliers?
+ Draw boxplots / histograms for univariate investigation
+ Look at mean, median, min, max, std, iqr, quantiles (1%, 5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 95%, 99%)
+ Draw scatter plots and correlation matrix for bivariate investigation
+ Impute missing values
+ Remove variables that have too many missings
+ Remove observations that have too many missings
+ Create log-transformed versions for highly skewed variables
+ Create bucketized versions for variables
+ Scale to [0,1] or mean=0, std=1
+ Clip values that are too small or too large
+ One-hot encoding, Label Encoding (0,1,2,3)
+ Select appropriate time slice
+ Plot variables over time
